###What is a Schedule
The Rise Vision platform gives you the ability to show more than one presentation or web page on any display, by allowing you to create schedules. 

A schedule is a defined list of presentations and/or URLs for a display, and it specifies both the order and the duration of each one’s appearance on the screen. You can also assign multiple schedules to a display (or group of displays), and control each schedule’s start and end times, start and end dates, and recurrence. 

###Create a Schedule

1. Within Rise Vision, click the “Schedules” link at the top of any page.
2. On the Schedules page, click the Add button.
3. In the Name field, enter a name for the new schedule. For now, leave the Timeline and Distribution at their default settings.

###Add a Presentation to your Schedule
1. Add a presentation to the Schedule by clicking either on “List is empty, Click here to add items”, or on the Add link.  
2. In the Content pop-up window that appears, click the Select link next to the presentation that you want to add.  Specify the name, duration and timeline settings, and then click the Okay button. 
3. Your newly added item will now be listed in the table under the heading “Presentation/URL”.  
4. Once you’ve finished adding all of your presentations and URL’s, click the Save button (to the right of the schedule’s Name field) to save your schedule.
5. To preview your new schedule, click the Preview button.
