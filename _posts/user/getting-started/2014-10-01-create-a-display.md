###What is a Display?
In the Rise Vision platform, “Display” refers to both the monitor that your content is shown on and the computer providing that content to that monitor.  The computer provides content to the monitor using the Rise Vision Player application. 

###Add your first display
To create a display in the Rise Vision platform;  

1. Within Rise Vision, click the “Displays” link at the top of any page 
2. Then click the “Add Display” button in the top right corner of the page. 
3. Give your display a name and click the Save button.  

Once saved, a Display ID is generated and will be shown on the dipslay settings page. This ID used to uniquly identify a Display.

If this is the first time you’re adding a display to the platform, a message will appear in red saying “Warning: No Player software is installed on the Display”.  This is simply a reminder that Rise Vision Player application must be installed on the computer that’s connected to your display.
