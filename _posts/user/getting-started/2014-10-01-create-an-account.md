To use the Rise Vision platform, the first step is to create your Rise account, by logging in to the Rise platform using your Google Account.  

If you don’t yet have a Google Account, you can create one at https://accounts.google.com/signup.  

For information about how to create a Google Account, see https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en&ref_topic=3382296.


###Log into Rise Vision
Once you have a Google Account, log in to the Rise platform using your Chrome browser. 

Go to: http://rva.risevision.com/ and follow the prompts:  

1. First, you’ll be asked to allow the Rise Vision application to access your Google Account.  To proceed, click “Allow”.  
2. Next, you’ll be asked to allow rdn-openid.appspot.com to access the Rise Vision Application Server.  To proceed, click “Allow Access”.  
3. Finally, you’ll see the “Welcome to Rise Vision” page, where you’ll be asked to allow Rise to set up a User account and a Company for you.  To proceed, click “I agree”.

After creating your Rise Vision account and logging in for the first time, you’ll see the Rise Vision interface with the following links at the very top of the page:  Start | Presentations | Gadgets | Storage | Displays | Schedules | Settings | Users | Network.  

Start by clicking on Settings.  On the Settings page, enter your company name and contact information, and specify your time zone.
