To use the Rise Vision platform, the first step is to create your Rise account, by logging in to the Rise platform using your Google Account.  

If you don’t yet have a Google Account, you can create one at https://accounts.google.com/signup.  

For information about how to create a Google Account, see https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en&ref_topic=3382296.


###Log into Rise Vision
Once you have a Google Account, log in to the Rise platform using your Chrome browser. 

Go to: http://rva.risevision.com/ and follow the prompts:  

1. First, you’ll be asked to allow the Rise Vision application to access your Google Account.  To proceed, click “Allow”.  
2. Next, you’ll be asked to allow rdn-openid.appspot.com to access the Rise Vision Application Server.  To proceed, click “Allow Access”.  
3. Finally, you’ll see the “Welcome to Rise Vision” page, where you’ll be asked to allow Rise to set up a User account and a Company for you.  To proceed, click “I agree”.

###The Rise Vision Interface
After creating your Rise Vision account and logging in for the first time, you’ll see the Rise Vision interface, with a number of links at the very top of the page.  These header links include, from left to right:  

1. The Rise Vision logo, which links to the company's website (www.risevision.com).
2. The main menu items to the right of the logo: Presentations | Gadgets | Displays | Schedules | Settings | Network.
3. The App Launcher: this is the icon that looks like a 3x3 grid of black dots (to the left of the username icon). Clicking on the App Launcher open a sub-menu with further links to the following areas: Editor, Store, Storage, Displays, Schedules, Support, Community, Documentation, Developer and About.
4. Your username icon: clicking on your username, company name or profile photo opens a sub-menu with further links to account-related areas and functions, including: Select Sub-Company, Add Sub-Company, Company Settings, Company Users, User Settings and Sign Out.

Start by clicking on Settings.  On the Settings page, enter your company name and contact information, and specify your time zone.
