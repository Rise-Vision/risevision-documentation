###What is a Presentation?
A presentation is a defined grouping and arrangement of all of the content that you wish to show on any given electronic display.  You can put many different types of content into a presentation, including images, text, video, animations, weather, financial data, headline news, sports scores, and much more.  

In the Rise Vision platform, a presentation is essentially a web (HTML) page that you can edit and preview in your browser. Your presentation can display a web page that already exists, a web page that you create yourself, or a web page that you create using our editor.  In this Getting Started guide, we’ll focus on how to use our editor to create the web page for your first presentation.



###Create a presentation from a template
To create your first presentation, use one of the pre-built presentation templates available in the Rise Vision platform. To do so: 

1. Click on the Presentation link at the top of the Rise Vision page, and then click the “Add from Template” button in the top right corner of the page.  This reveals a list of pre-configured presentation templates.  
2. Click the “Preview” link located to the right of a template’s name to see its layout and contents.  This opens a new browser tab with a preview of that template, allowing you to see how it looks and decide if that’s the layout that you’d like to use.  
3. Close the template preview tab to return to the list of templates.
4. To select that template, click the “Select” link to the left of its name.  This opens a copy of the template in your Presentations window, with the header “Copy of [name of template]”.  To change the name, click the Presentation Settings icon (the cog image) in the top right corner of the page, type in the new name and click the Okay button.
5. To save this presentation, click the Copy icon in the top right corner (the floppy disk image). This places your new copy of the template into your account’s list of presentations, making it available for you to customize for your own displays. 

The Presentations page offers two ways to add content to a presentation: by using the Design tab to add and arrange the content in a WYSIWYG interface, or by using the HTML tab to edit the underlying code directly.
