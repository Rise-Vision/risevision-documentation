In the Rise Vision platform, the term “display” usually refers to two things together: both the electronic sign itself (i.e., the screen that shows your content), and the computer that’s connected to that sign and sends the content to it.  In order for your electronic sign to be able to show content from the Rise Vision platform, the computer that it’s connected to must be able to access the Internet, and it must also be running the Rise Vision Player.

Click the Displays link at the top of the Rise Vision page to access the Display area of the platform.  This is where you can add, remove, configure, connect, disconnect and restart any display in your network.
