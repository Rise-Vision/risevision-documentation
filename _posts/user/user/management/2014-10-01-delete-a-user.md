###Delete a User
1. Click the Users link at the top of any page.
2. Click the Username of the user that you wish to delete.  This takes you to the properties page for that user.
3. Click the Delete button situated to the right of the Username field.
4. This opens a Delete User Confirmation window, asking you to ‘Please type “DELETE” in the dialog below’.  You must type the word in all caps, without the quotation marks, or you’ll get a message in red saying ‘Cannot confirm operation’.
5. Click the Okay button.  This removes the user and returns you to the main Users page with the list of remaining users.
