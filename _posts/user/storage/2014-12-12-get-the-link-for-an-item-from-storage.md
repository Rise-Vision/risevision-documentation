You can obtain the URL for any file that's in your Storage area. This is useful in situations where you want that file to appear in a presentation or a web page. To get the link:

1. In the Storage window, click the checkmark box beside the name of the desired file
2. Next, click the Link button that appears in the top right corner (it's the middle button with the image of the three chain links arranged diagonally). This opens a new "Link to (*file name*)" window showing the complete URL for that file, already highlighted.
3. Press Control-C on your keyboard to copy the URL to your computer's clipboard.
4. To paste this URL elsewhere (for example, into a presentation or web page), navigate to that location, place your cursor where you want the link to appear, and press Control-V to paste the link from your clipboard.
