##How to access Storage settings

1. Click the Storage link at the top of the Rise Vision page.
2. Click the gear icon (also called the cog icon) in the top right corner of the Storage page. 
3. This opens a sub-menu showing your current company at the top, and several company-related menu choices beneath. Each menu item is explained below.

##Storage Settings##
####Current Company####
This shows the name of the company whose storage files you are currently accessing. If you logged in to Rise Vision as your parent company, your parent company's name will be shown here as well.

####Select Sub-Company####
Clicking this opens a new Select Sub-Company window showing you a list of your sub-companies.  Click the name of the sub-company whose Storage files you wish to see. This takes you to that sub-company's Storage page, which is indicated by a highlighted message at the top of the page that says "You're in Sub-Company (*name of sub-comany*)". To return to your parent company at any point, click the "Switch to My Company" link also located at the top of the page.

####Add Sub-Company####
Clicking this opens a new Add Sub-Company window where you can fill in the details to add a new sub-company to your Rise Vision account. This has the same result as adding a sub-company from the platform's main Settings page.

Please note: when you've entered the details for your new sub-company, clicking Save does not automatically take you to that sub-company's Storage page.  It simply adds that new sub-company to your account, closes the Add Sub-Company window, and returns you to the Storage page of your parent company.

####Company Settings####
Clicking this opens a new Company Settings windows where you can check and modify the details of your company. This has the same result as editing your company details on the platform's main Settings page.

**Caution:** do not click the red Delete button at the bottom of this Company Settings window unless you want to delete your company permanently. Clicking it will open a pop-up window asking you if you're sure you want to delete your company.

####Company Users####
Clicking this opens a new Company Users window where you can see a list of all users in your company, or click the green Add User button to add a new user. Clicking on an existing user's name opens a new User Settings window where you can check and modify the details of that user. Clicking the Add User button opens a new Add User window where you can enter the details for a person that you wish to add as a new user.  Using the functions available in this area has the same result as editing and adding users on the platform's main Users page.
