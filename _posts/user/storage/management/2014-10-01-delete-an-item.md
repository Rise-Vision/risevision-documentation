To permanently remove a file or folder from Storage:

1. In the Storage window, click the checkmark box beside the name of the desired file or folder (you can select multiple items for simultaneous deletion), and then click the Delete link (the trash can icon).
2. A pop-up window will appear asking you to “Please confirm PERMANENT deletion of: (file or folder name)”
3. Click the Delete button to confirm deletion (or the Cancel button if you change your mind and don’t want to delete it).

Deleting a file removes it completely from Storage, and also removes it from any presentations into which it had previously been placed.
