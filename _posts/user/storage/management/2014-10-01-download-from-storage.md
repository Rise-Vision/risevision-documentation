You can download a copy of any file from Storage to your computer.  To download a file:

1. In the Storage window, click the checkmark box beside the name of the desired file, and then click the Download link (the cloud icon with the down arrow).
2. Navigate to the location on your computer where you want to save the file.
3. Click Save.
 
Downloading a file puts a copy of that file on your computer, but does not remove it from Storage.
