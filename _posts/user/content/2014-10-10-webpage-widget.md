##What it does
The Web Page Widget is another open source project that provides you with the ability to show a web page within your Presentation. To get started, add the Web Page Widget to your Presentation. Once added, open the Widget Settings and enter the URL of the web page to show in the Presentation. Further customization can be made if necessary, but the URL is the only required field. Once youâ€™ve configured the Widget Settings, publish the Presentation for the web page to appear on your Displays!
 
##How to configure it
To configure this widget, click the Configure link.  If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the Placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Clicking the Configure link opens a Web Page Settings window, in which you can configure the following settings:

#####URL
This is the URL the Widget will show.

#####Horizontal Scroll (pixels)
Specify how far on the web page, in pixels, that the Widget will begin at from the left.

#####Vertical Scroll (pixels)
Specify how far on the web page, in pixels, that the Widget will begin at from the top.

#####Zoom
This will allow you to zoom in or out of a web page. If the value chosen here is higher than 100% then the Scrollbars Enabled setting listed below will be disabled.

#####Interactive
Allow users to interact with the web page.
Scrollbars Enabled: Available only if Interactive is selected and the Zoom value chosen is 100% or less. Scrollbars will appear if the portion of the web page you are showing is too large to show in its entirety.
Data Refresh Interval (minutes): Determines the frequency the Widget will refresh the URL. The default is Do Not Refresh.
