In general usage, "content" can refer to any type of item that appears in a presentation, whether it's text, an image, a video, a web page or a widget.

But in the Rise Vision platform, the term “content”, as encountered when you're adding an item to a placeholder's playlist, refers most specifically to widgets. When you click the Add link in a placeholder's playlist, selecting **Content** brings you to the Rise Vision store's list of available widgets.

In the same area of the platform, the term is also used to refer to items (most often, web pages) that are brought in to a presentation from the web. When you click the Add link in a placeholder's playlist, selecting **Content by URL** brings you to a window where you can specify the URL of any web page (or widget that uses the widget API) that you wish to add to the playlist.
