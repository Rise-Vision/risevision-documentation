##What it does
The Image Folder Widget allows you to create a playlist of images (essentially, a slideshow) simply by selecting the folder from your Rise Vision Storage area that contains all of the desired images.  Add the widget to your placeholder in the usual way (see [Add a Widget to your Presentation](http://help.stage.risevision.com/#/user/content/add-a-widget-to-a-presentation)), and then configure it as described below to select which folder to use.

##How to configure it
To configure this widget, open the properties window for the placeholder containing this widget, and click the widget's Configure link.  If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Clicking the Configure link opens the **Image Folder Settings** window.  

#####Save/Cancel/Contribute
At the top of the window there are three buttons:
- **Save:**  This saves your settings for this widget.
- **Cancel:**  This cancels any changes youâ€™ve made to your settings since you last saved them.
- **Contribute:**  This takes you to the GitHub repository for this widget.  As an open source project, all code for this widget is available on GitHub, allowing you to contribute your own versions or modifications if you wish to do so.

Below these three buttons, you can configure the following settings:
#####URL
This is the path to the folder in Storage that contains the images that will be included in your playlist. If you know folder's the exact path, type or paste it into this field. Alternatively, you can select the folder:
1. Click on the Storage icon (the database/Rise logo icon) located to the right of this field. This opens a new Storage window showing a list of your Storage files and folders.  
2. Navigate to the desired folder, click the checkmark beside its name to select it, and click the Select button.  This closes the Storage window and places the URL of the selected folder into the URL field.

#####Scale to Fit
Click this checkbox if you would like the images in this folder to be proportionally resized when displayed to match the height of the placeholder containing this widget. 

#####Alignment
This controls the positioning of the images within the placeholder containing this widget. Click the down arrow to the right of this field to reveal its drop-down list, and then click again to select the desired alignment. Options are Top Left, Top Center, Top Right, Middle Left, Middle Center, Middle Right, Bottom Left, Bottom Center, or Bottom Right.

#####Order
This controls the order in which the images in the selected folder appear in the playlist. Click the down arrow to the right of this field to reveal its drop-down list, and then click again to select the desired order. Options are:

- **A to Z:** Images will appear in alphabetical order based on the image file name.
- **Z to A:** Images will appear in reverse-alphabetical order based on the image file name.
- **Date Ascending:** Images will appear in order of their file date, from oldest to newest.
- **Date Descending:** Images will appear in order of their file date, from newest to oldest.
- **Random:** Images will appear in random order.


#####Duration
This controls the amount of time (in seconds) that each image in the playlist is displayed. To change the default duration (5 seconds), select the number in this field and replace it with the desired duration.

#####Pause
This controls the amount of time (in seconds) that the playlist pauses after being interacted with (manually skipping forward or reverse).

#####Auto Hide Navigation
The slideshow has built-in navigation buttons (a left arrow and a right arrow, on either side of the images) which are always visible when this checkbox is unchecked. Click to check this checkbox if you would like these navigation buttons to disappear after the first 3 seconds.
