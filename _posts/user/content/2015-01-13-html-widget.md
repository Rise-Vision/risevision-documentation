##What it does
The HTML widget allows you to embed HTML content - that is, content written to be viewed in a web browser - directly into your presentation. This can be HTML code that you wrote yourself, or a snippet of HTML code that you copied from a website to embed into your presentation.

This widget allows you to embed many types of HTML content into your presentation, including:
- entire web pages
- excerpts from web pages
- Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn feeds
- RSS feeds from blogs and news sites
- videos from YouTube, Vimeo or other sites
- MP3 and other audio files and players
- content from Google Maps, Calendars, Docs and Charts
- images and slideshows from Flickr, Tumblr and other photo and art sites
- buttons, widgets or entire boards from Pinterest
- and any other type of web content for which an embed code can be obtained.

##How to add it to a presentation
To put this widget on a display:

1. Add a new placeholder to a presentation.   
2. In the placeholder's Properties window, click the Add link and select Content to open a new window showing the Rise Vision store.
3. Find and click the widget named "HTML". This takes you to the widgetâ€™s description page.
4. Click the green "Add +" button to add it to your playlist. This closes the store window and returns you to the Placeholder window, where HTML Widget now appears in the placeholder's playlist.

##How to configure it
To configure this widget to show the desired HTML content, click its Configure link (in the placeholder window). If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Clicking the Configure link opens an HTML Settings window, showing three buttons at the top (Save, Cancel and Contribute) and a code area with numbered lines underneath, into which you can add the HTML code of the content that you wish to show in the placeholder.

###How to add the HTML code to the HTML Settings' code area
Generally, you will add one of two main types of HTML code to this area: either the embed code that shows a specific piece of web content (like a Google Map or a Twitter feed), or the full code that shows an entire web page's content.

####To add an embed code:
1. From the site that has the specific piece of web content that you want to embed into your presentation, find the content's "embed code". Each source site has a slightly different procedure for configuring and generating the embed code that you need, but most have a "Share" and/or an "Embed" link, and often also have some instructions on how to get the embed code that you will need. Often, that embed code begins with  `<iframe`  and ends with `</iframe>`
2. Select the embed code and copy it to your clipboard by pressing Ctrl-C on your keyboard.
3. In the code area of the HTML Settings window, single-click to place your cursor in the blank line between `<body>` and `</body>` (which in a new HTML Settings window will be line 9, if no other alterations have been made yet to the code in that area).
4. Press Ctrl-V to paste the embed code from your clipboard into the area between `<body>` and `</body>`.
5. Click the green Save button.  This saves your code changes, closes the HTML Settings window and returns you to the placeholder window.
6. Click the Save button at the bottom of the placeholder window. This saves your placeholder changes, closes the placeholder window and returns you to the main presentation page.
7. Finally, click the Save (floppy disk) icon in the top right corner of the presentation page. This saves your changes to the presentation.
8. To preview your new embedded HTML code in your presentation, click the Preview icon (the green "play" icon) in the top right corner of the presentation page.

####To add an entire web page's code:
1. Select the HTML code for the web page that you wish to place into your presentation and copy it to your clipboard by pressing Ctrl-C on your keyboard. Normally, a full web page's code will begin with `<!DOCTYPE` and end with `</html>`.
2. ==Note:== Remember that all links contained in your page's HTML code - including links to images, style sheets, web fonts and any other external assets used on the page - must be absolute links (i.e., containing the full http:// path to wherever each item is hosted on the web). Relative links, like those normally contained in the code of a typical website's page, will not work in this widget.
3. In the code area of the HTML Settings window, select and delete all of the supplied HTML code (which in a new HTML Settings window will be lines 1-11, if no other alterations have been made yet to the code in that area).
4. Press Ctrl-V to paste the HTML code from your clipboard into the code area.
5. Click the green Save button.  This saves your code changes, closes the HTML Settings window and returns you to the placeholder window.
6. Click the Save button at the bottom of the placeholder window. This saves your placeholder changes, closes the placeholder window and returns you to the main presentation page.
7. Finally, click the Save (floppy disk) icon in the top right corner of the presentation page. This saves your changes to the presentation.
8. To preview your new web page's HTML code in your presentation, click the Preview icon (the green "play" icon) in the top right corner of the presentation page.
