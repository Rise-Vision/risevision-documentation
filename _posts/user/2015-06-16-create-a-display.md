###What’s a Display
We use the term “Display” to refer to both the screen and computer (media player) that together show your content on your digital signage. The media player uses Rise Player to receive and publish your content on your screen.

###Add a Display
From Rise Vision select **Displays** and then **Add Display**. Give your Display a name and save it.
Once saved a *Display ID* is generated and you will use that ID to register the media player you install Rise Player on next.

###Rise Player Options
Rise Windows Player and Rise Linux Player install to your local media player, and include a built in watchdog program that will monitor Rise Player and automatically relaunch it if it closes.

Rise Player Chrome Extension is a lightweight addon for ChromeOS and Chrome browser. It can be installed on any media player that has a Chrome Browser.

###Rise Windows Player
Download Rise Windows Player [here](http://install-versions.risevision.com/rvplayer-installer.exe). Double click the downloaded **rvplayer-installer.exe** file, and follow the prompts for installation. When prompted, enter the **Display ID** you created above.

To stop Rise Windows Player enter the key combination *Control + W* on your keyboard.

We recommend that you check out the Rise [Windows Player Optimization Guide](user/advanced/display/rise-windows-player) to further prepare your media player to display digital signage!

###Rise Linux Player
Download Rise Linux Player [here](http://install-versions.risevision.com/rvplayer-installer.sh). Right click **rvplayer-installer.sh**, click **Properties**. Select the **Permissions** tab and *Check* **Allow executing file as program**. Click **Close**. Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory you downloaded rvplayer-installer.sh to, and type ./rvplayer-installer.sh. When prompted, enter the **Display ID** you created above.

We recommend that you check out the [Rise Linux Player Optimization Guide](user/advanced/display/rise-linux-player) to further prepare your media player to display digital signage!

###Rise Player on Chrome OS
Please consult our [Chrome OS Optimization Guide](user/advanced/display/configure-kiosk-mode) for more information about setting up Rise Player on Chrome OS.

###Rise Player Chrome Extension on Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04, or Mac OS X
Confirm that your media player has the latest version of Chrome installed and if it doesn’t download it from [www.google.com/chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

Now install [Rise Player](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rise-vision-chrome-app-pl/mfpgpdablffhbfofnhlpgmokokbahooi) from the Chrome Web Store and then start it. When prompted enter the **Display ID** you created above.

To stop Rise Player enter the key combination *Control + W* on your keyboard.

Now, you'll want to consult the Optimization Guide for [Windows](user/advanced/display/chrome-player-windows), [Ubuntu](user/advanced/display/chrome-player-linux), or [OSX](user/advanced/display/chrome-player-mac).

Note that if you’re using a non-supported operating system you’ll need to make sure to disable any screen saver, display standby/sleep mode, as well as configuring the Rise Player App to start automatically after a reboot. Rise Player is a Chrome Application that can run anywhere Chrome runs but please take note we only support Ubuntu, Windows, Chrome OS and Mac OS X.
