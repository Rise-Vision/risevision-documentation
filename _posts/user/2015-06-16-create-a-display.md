###What’s a Display
We use the term “Display” to refer to both the screen and device (media player) that together show your content on your digital signage. And our application, Rise Player, is installed on the media player (device) and it renders and publishes your content on the display.

**Not sure what type of device hardware you need? Consider the following:**

| Hardware Component | Good (I only need to show text and images) | Better (I need to show some video content) | Best (I need to show a lot of videos and dynamic content) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Processor | Celeron or equivalent processor | Intel Core i3 or equivalent processor | Intel Core i5 or equivalent processor |
| Memory | 4GB | 6GB + | 8GB + |
| Storage | 32GB | 32GB + | 64GB + |
| Operating System | Windows 7+ or Linux Ubuntu 64bit | Windows 7+ or Linux Ubuntu 64bit | Windows 7+ 64bit |
| Examples | [Windows](https://goo.gl/u9efvJ) and [Linux](https://goo.gl/Epo4Wc) | [Windows](https://goo.gl/RC2z2B) and [Linux](https://goo.gl/CLsPPC) | [Windows](https://store.risevision.com/product/104/intel-nuc-i5-windows) |

###Add a Display
From [Displays](https://apps.risevision.com/displays) select Add Display and then give your new display a name and save it. Once saved, a Display ID is generated and you will use that ID to pair the device that you install Rise Player on. It is best to install Rise Player on a dedicated device (not your personal computer) as it will continuously run full screen.

###Install Rise Player
Please note that if you have a firewall or proxy you may need to configure it to allow our service on port 80 (http) and 443 (https) for the following addresses:

- rvashow2.appspot.com
- rvashow.appspot.com
- rvaserver2.appspot.com
- storage-dot-rvaserver2.appspot.com
- store.risevision.com
- commondatastorage.googleapis.com
- googleapis.com
- accounts.google.com
- talkgadget.google.com
- s3.amazonaws.com
- p.jwpcdn.com/6/5/jwpsrv.js (Only necessary if your Presentation includes videos)
- rackcdn.com

And if you are using [Rise Priority Support](https://store.risevision.com/product/14/rise-priority-support) and taking advantage of our remote diagnostic and correction service we will also need port 8041 open for the address connect.risevision.com.

If you have questions or problems with the installation of your Display please let us know in the [Community](http://community.risevision.com) and we will do our best to get you up and running in no time.

####Ubuntu Installation
To run the Ubuntu installation open a terminal window, navigate to the directory that contains the installation file, and run the following commands (do not run the installer as root or via sudo).  If you are running the 64 bit installer, replace with installer-lnx-64.sh:

    chmod +x installer-lnx-32.sh
    ./installer-lnx-32.sh

And then continue with the Rise Player installation instructions.

To **stop Rise Player On Ubuntu**, press the super key, then type ‘rise’ to display the Stop Player shortcut, then click it.
- - - 
####Windows Installation
If your browser asks "Do you want to run or save..." click "Run" if you are downloading from the dedicated Rise Player device, otherwise click "Save" and copy the installation to the Rise Player dedicated device and then run the installation on it.

Please note that Microsoft has introduced a new system for verifying the authenticity of desktop applications called SmartScreen that may trigger warnings when you download and install Rise Player. While this new system does insure that you are downloading an application that has not been tampered with, it also introduces errant warnings, especially with newly released software applications and updates. **If you see "Rise Player Installation is not commonly downloaded and could harm your computer."  Click on "Actions" and then "Run anyway" and if you see "Windows protected your PC.  Windows SmartScreen prevented an unrecognized app from starting. Running this app might put your PC at risk." Click on "More info" to reveal other options and then click "Run anyway".**

And then continue with the Rise Player installation instructions.

To **stop Rise Player on Windows**, press the windows key on your keyboard to bring up the Windows start menu, and then find the Rise Vision group and click the Stop Player shortcut.

####Raspberry Pi Installation
Please note that support for Raspberry Pi installation is a community initiative dubbed "Riseberry" and you can find more information on it [here](https://community.risevision.com/rise_vision_inc/topics/community-supported-raspberry-pi-2-instructions-riseberry).
- - - 
####Chrome OS Installation
**Please be aware that we are currently evaluating Chrome Application development due to control and stability issues that we have had with our Rise Player Chrome Application.**

We recommend that all Chrome OS devices be registered under Chrome device management as it will allow Rise Player to launch automatically when the device is turned on. We recommend that you restrict your Chrome version to one major release behind the current version to ensure your content is not adversely impacted by an update and that you thoroughly test your content on the new version prior to upgrading.

From Google Device Management create an Organizational Unit for your Digital Signage Players and configure the settings as per the following:

1. Set **Power Management** to *Do not allow device to sleep/shut down when on sign in screen*
2. Set **Sign-in Screen** to *Never show user names and photos*
3. Configure **Kiosk Apps** by adding the [Rise Player Application](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rise-vision-chrome-app-pl/ilcmohdkjfcfekfmpdppgoaaemgdmhaa)
 1. Click **Manage Kiosk Applications**
 2. Select **Chrome Web Store**
 3. Search for *Rise Player*
4. Configure Kiosk Settings as per the following:
 1. Set **Public Session Kiosk** for *Do not allow Public Session Kiosk*
 2. Configure Rise Player as the **Auto-Launch Kiosk App**
5. Set **Auto Update** to *Allow auto-updates*
6. Set **Restrict Google Chrome version to at most** to *47.**.
7. Set **Randomly scatter auto-updates over** to *None*
8. Set **Auto reboot after updates** to *Disallow auto-reboots*
9. Set **Release Channel** to *Move to Stable Channel*

Once configured, power on your Chromebox, connect it to your network, and at the login screen press Control+Alt+E on your keyboard, and then type in the enrollment email and password associated with your Google account. If an enrollment prompt does not appear, please wipe your Chromebox and repeat this step.

Upon startup you will be prompted to enter the Display ID that was assigned to the Display that was set up in Rise Vision.

To stop Rise Player, power cycle your Chromebox. When the Rise Player application is loading, press the key combination of Control + Alt + S on your keyboard to boot into Chrome OS instead of Rise Player.
