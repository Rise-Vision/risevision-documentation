###What’s a Display
We use the term “Display” to refer to both the screen and computer (media player) that together show your content on your digital signage. The media player uses 
the Chrome browser and the Rise Player Chrome Application to receive and publish your content on your screen. 

###Add a Display
From Rise Vision select **Displays** and then **Add Display**. Give your Display a name and save it.
Once saved a *Display ID* is generated and you will use that ID to register the media player you install Rise Player on next.

###Install Rise Windows Player
Rise Windows Player for Windows 8.1 is the preffered way to display beautiful digital signage on your Display.

Download Rise Windows Player [here](http://install-versions.risevision.com/rvplayer-installer.exe). Double click the downloaded rvplayer-installer.exe file, and follow the prompts for installation. When prompted, enter the **Display ID** you created above.

To stop Rise Windows Player enter the key combination *Control + W* on your keyboard.

We recommend that you check out the Rise [Windows Player Optimization Guide](user/advanced/display/rise-windows-player) to further prepare your media player to display digital signage!

###Install Rise Linux Player
If your media player has Ubuntu 14.04 installed as it's Operating System, you can use it to display your digital signage with Rise Linux Player!

###Rise Player Chrome Extension on Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04, or Mac OS X
The Rise Player Chrome Extension is an alternative player that can be used on on OS that has a current version of Google Chrome on it.

Confirm that your media player has the latest version of Chrome installed and if it doesn’t download it from [www.google.com/chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

then start it. When prompted enter the **Display ID** you created above.

Note that if you’re using a non-supported operating system you’ll need to make sure to disable any screen saver, display standby/sleep mode, as well as 
configuring the Rise Player App to start automatically after a reboot. Rise Player is a Chrome Application that can run anywhere Chrome runs but please take 
note we only support Ubuntu, Windows, Chrome OS and Mac OS X.
