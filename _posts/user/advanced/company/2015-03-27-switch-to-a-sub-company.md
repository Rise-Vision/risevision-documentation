As a parent company, you can switch to the Settings page of any of your sub-companies whenever you want to manage that sub-company’s users, presentations, widgets, storage, displays or schedules.
 
To switch to a sub-company’s account:

1. Click your username icon in the top right header area of any page. This opens a sub-menu of company-related items.
2. Click the Select Sub-Company link. This opens a new Select Sub-Company window, showing a list of all sub-companies that you have previously added or moved to your company.
3. Click the name of the sub-company that you want to switch to. This will take you to the corresponding page of that sub-company.  The sub-company’s name is now displayed on the top of all pages (within the light-red banner).  On the Settings page, it also appears on the top left side (beneath the top banner).
4. You can now navigate around the platform, and make changes, as the sub-company.
