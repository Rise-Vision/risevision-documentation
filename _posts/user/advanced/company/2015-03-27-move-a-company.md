If a user already has a company on the Rise Vision platform and wants to be part of your network, you can make it a sub-company of your network by moving it.  You will need the Authentication Key of the company you wish to move.
 
To move a company into your account:

1. Click your username icon in the top right header area of any page. This opens a sub-menu of company-related items.
2. Click the Add Sub-Company link. This opens a new Add Sub-Company window.
3. Click the "Move a Company Under Your Company" link at the bottom of the window. This opens a new Move Company window.
4. Enter the Authentication Key of the company that you want to move, and then click "Retrieve Company Details".  If the key is valid, this displays the details of the company you want to move, as well as the details of the company under which you will be moving it (i.e., your company).
5. If those details are correct, click the green Move Company button to make that company  a sub-company in your network.  The move will be confirmed with a message that says "Success. The company has been moved under your company." 
6. Click the Close button to close the Move Company window. Then click the Cancel button to close the Add Sub-Company window.
