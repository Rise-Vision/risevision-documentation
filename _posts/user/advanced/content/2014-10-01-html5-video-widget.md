##What it does
The Video Widget allows you to an HTML5 compatible video directly into your Presentation. Video files can be hosted on Rise Storage, your server or a 3rd party server.

##Supported Video Format
While you are free to add a MP4, OGG or an OGM encoded video to your Presentation, we only support one video format, WebM. Why? Because WebM was built for delivering video content over the web, which means it is adaptable to varying processing and bandwidth conditions, resulting in a better experience for our User, You! If you’re interested in learning more about WebM take a look at the documentation on the WebM site here.

If you see issues with a video in your Presentation, and the problematic video(s) are not WebM encoded, please convert to WebM before contacting Support.

##How to add it to a presentation
To put this widget on a display:

1. In the placeholder's Properties window, click the Add link and select Content to open the Rise Vision store.  
2. Click the widget named Video Widget . This takes you to the product’s description and pricing information.  
3. Click the Add button to add it to your playlist.  This closes the store window and returns you to the Placeholder window, where Video Widget now appears in the placeholder's playlist.

##How to configure it
To configure this widget, click the Configure link.  If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the Placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Clicking the Configure link opens the Video Settings window, in which you can configure the following settings:

#####URL
In this field, you can either input your own video URL for off-site hosting, or use the storage link to choose a video from your Rise Storage account. This URL must direct to a valid video file.

#####Auto Play
Determines if the Video should start automatically or if it waits for user input.

#####Volume
This specifies the initial volume for the video. If user input is allowed, the volume can be adjusted during playback as well.

#####Background
In this field you can specify what color or image should be displayed behind your video. Additional alignment and scaling options are available if an image is specified.
