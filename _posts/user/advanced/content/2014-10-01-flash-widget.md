##What it does
The Flash Widget allows you to embed Flash content directly into your Presentation. The Flash file must be accessible from a URL and only the .SWF file format is supported.


##How to configure it
To configure this widget, open the properties window for the placeholder containing this widget, and click the widget's Configure link. If this is the only item in the placeholder's playlist, the Configure link is in the Settings area at the bottom of the placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this widget opens an Item window and the Configure link is in the Settings area of that window.

Type or paste the URL of your Flash file into the URL field of the configuration page.

Two different file types are supported:
- Application
	- Applications are used for presentations that are interactive. Applications include things like interactive buttons, menus, or maps with navigation.
- Movie
	- Movies are repeatable flash videos. These can be used for backgrounds, ad placeholders, or other non-interactive content.
