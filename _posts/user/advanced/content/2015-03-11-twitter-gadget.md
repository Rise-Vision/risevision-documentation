##What it does
The Twitter Gadget allows you to display Tweets in a Presentation. The Gadget shows Tweets based on your search query and will display them from most recent to oldest. 

##How to add it to a presentation
To put this Gadget on a display:

1. In the Placeholder's Properties window, click the Add link and select Content to open the Rise Vision store.  
2. Click the Gadget named Twitter. This takes you to the product’s description and pricing information.  
3. Click the Add button to add it to your playlist.  This closes the store window and returns you to the Placeholder window, where Twitter now appears in the Placeholder's playlist.

##How to configure it
If this is the only item in the Placeholder's playlist, the Settings area should already be visible at the bottom of the Placeholder window, right below the playlist. If there are multiple items in the playlist, clicking the name of this Gadget opens an Item window showing the Settings area.

Before you can use the Twitter Gadget in your Presentation, you need to add a Twitter Social Connector to your Company. You can learn more about Social Connectors [here]({{site.absoluteurl}}user/company/company-settings).

In the Settings area you can configure the following options:

#####Twitter Query
The supported Twitter queries can be found [here](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/search). Twitter requires that the header which is comprised of the word “Tweets” as well as the Twitter logo be present while using the Twitter Gadget.

#####Time Between Tweets
Time Between Tweets determines how fast the next Tweet appears onscreen.

#####Number of Tweets
Number of Tweets determines how many Tweets you want to display before going back to the first one.

#####Avatar Size
You can choose the size of the Avatar in the Avatar Size dropdown box.

#####Header/Tweet/Timestamp Font
In these fields you can set the appearance of the font for the text that displays this Gadgets's data.

#####Scroll Direction
Choose the Scroll Direction for the Tweets that show up in your Presentation.

#####Background Color
You can pick a Background Color, including transparency.

#####Show Separator
Checking the Show Separator checkbox will show a divider between Tweets.
