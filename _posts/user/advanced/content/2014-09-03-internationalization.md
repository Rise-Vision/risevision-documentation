##Internationalization
If you would like to see a Rise Vision Widget or Application displayed in a language other than English, please follow the steps below.

1. Download the EN.PO file from the locales folder in the repository you wish to contribute a translation for. All Rise Vision repos can be found at [https://github.com/Rise-Vision](https://github.com/Rise-Vision).

2. Download and install [POEdit](http://poedit.net/). This is software that you can use to write translations into another language.
3.  Open the translation file in the POEdit program and set the language for which you are writing a translation.

4.   In the Source text window, you will see the English word or phrase to be translated. You can provide a translation for it in the Translation window.

5.  When the translation is complete, save it with a .po extension and email the file to support@risevision.com. Please be sure to indicate which Widget or app the translation file is for, as well as the language that it has been translated into, and we will integrate it as soon as we can.
