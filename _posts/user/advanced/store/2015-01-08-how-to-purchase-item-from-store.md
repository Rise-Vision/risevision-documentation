###How to purchase an item from the Store
To purchase an item from the Rise Vision Store, navigate to the page of the desired product or service, click its Add to Cart button, and then go to your shopping cart page to complete your purchase.

#####To navigate to an item:

1. Go to the Store by clicking the Store link in the top menu of any Rise Vision page.  (You can also access the Store from the Presentations area of the platform, by adding new content to a placeholder. See [Add a Widget to your Presentation](http://help.risevision.com/#/user/content/add-a-widget-to-a-presentation).)
2. Find the desired product or service by either browsing the items on the Store's home page, or by using the "Search Products" field at the top of the page.
3. Select the item you wish to purchase by clicking on either its image or its price. This takes you to the product page for that item.


#####To add the item to your cart:

1. If more than one price option is listed on the product page (for example, payment for a month vs. payment for a year), select the one you want.
2. If the item has a Quantity field (shown as "Qty.") and you want to buy more than one, replace the default value (usually "1") with the number of units you want to buy.
3. When you're ready to purchase the item, click the Add To Cart button. This adds the item to your shopping cart, changes the button into a "Go To Cart" button, and also adds a blue box with a number (indicating the total number of products in your cart) to the shopping cart icon at the top of the page.
4. If you want to buy other items from the Store before checking out, click the "Continue Shopping" button at the bottom of the product page (or the Store link at the top of the page) to return to the Store's home page.

#####To go to your shopping cart page:

1. When you're ready to check out and pay for your item(s), go to your shopping cart page by clicking on either the "Go To Cart" button at the bottom of an added-to-cart item's product page, or the shopping cart icon at the top of any Store page.  This take you to your shopping cart page.
2. Review the Bill To and Ship To addresses shown, and click the Edit Address icons (the pencil icons) if you wish to make changes to them.  If your address information is incomplete or incorrect, the problems will be listed in an "Address Validation Error" message in a light red box on this page. Click the Edit Address icon to supply the missing information; doing so will remove the error message and allow you to place the order.
3. Review the details of your order in the "Review Your Order" area. Here, you can remove an item from your cart by clicking the red circle (with the minus sign icon) to the left of the item's name.  You can also change the quantity of any item that allows multiple units to be purchased.

#####To place your order:

1. When the addresses are validated and you're satisfied with all the details and quantities of your order, complete your purchase by clicking the green "Place Your Order $" button. If you don't see that button, check again for any alert messages on the page, which will detail the reason(s) that the order cannot yet be placed.
2. Clicking the "Place Your Order $" button will open a new "Place Your Order" window for you to enter your credit card details. Required fields are indicated with a red asterisk, and you can also choose to designate that credit card as your Default Card for future purchases.  
3. Once you've entered all required credit card information, click the green "Place Your Order $(amount)" button to finalize the purchase. If any fields are missing or invalid, they will be listed in a light red Error(s) box at the top of the window. Correct those errors and click again on the green "Place Your Order $(amount)" button.
