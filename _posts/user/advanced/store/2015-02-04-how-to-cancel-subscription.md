##How to cancel a subscription

1. Click the Store link in the top menu of any Rise Vision page to navigate to the Account area of the Rise Vision Store.

2. Click the Account link in the top menu of the Store page. This takes you to your company's Account page, where your active subscriptions are listed in the "Subscriptions" area. (If you have numerous subscriptions, you can also see the full list by clicking the "Show All >" link on the right side of the Subscriptions area.)

3. Find the subscription that you wish to cancel and click the ">" arrow on the right side of that subscription's row. This takes you to a new page entitled "(*Product Name*) Subscription" that lists all of the details of your subscription to that product.

4. At the very bottom of the subscription page, click the red "Cancel Subscription **x**" button. This will transform that button into a "Confirm Cancellation!" button.

5. Click the red button a second time to confirm that you wish to cancel your subscription.  A confirmation message will appear at the bottom of the subscription page saying "Your subscription was successfully cancelled and closed". You will also receive an email confirming that you have successfully cancelled the subscription.

6. Click the grey "< Account" button at the bottom of the subscription page to return to your Account page. The subscription that you just cancelled will no longer be listed in the "Subscriptions" area of your Account page.
