A user is anyone who is authorized to log in to your Rise Vision account.  You can allow others in your company to log in to the Rise Vision platform by entering them as users.  You can also assign different roles to different users.  Each role has its own permissions and capabilities.  A user can be a presentation editor, a presentation publisher, a display editor, an administrator, or a purchaser of items from the Rise Vision store.
