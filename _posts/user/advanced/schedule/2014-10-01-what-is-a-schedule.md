A schedule is a defined list of presentations and/or URLs for a display, and it specifies the timing, order and the duration of each presentation’s and web page’s appearance on the screen.  Schedules allow you to show more than one presentation or web page on any display.  You can also assign multiple displays to a schedule, and can control each schedule’s start and end times, start and end dates, and recurrence.  

Because you can configure the timeline, distribution and duration for each schedule, as well as all URLs and presentations in that schedule, an almost endless number of scheduling possibilities are available for you to control what content is shown, and when, on each display.

Note that if a player has not been assigned to a schedule, it will only display a loading circle until assigned.
