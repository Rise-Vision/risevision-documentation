######If your Storage subscription is active:
You can download a copy of any file from Storage to your computer.  To download a file:

1. In the Storage window, click the checkmark box beside the name of the desired file, and then click the Download link (the cloud icon with the down arrow).
2. Navigate to the location on your computer where you want to save the file.
3. Click Save.
 
Downloading a file puts a copy of that file on your computer, but does not remove it from Storage.

######If your Storage subscription is no longer active:
You can also follow the above steps to retrieve your files when your Storage subscription is no longer active. Files that you previously uploaded when your Storage subscription was active will remain available for you to download to your computer, as long as you continue to have a Rise Vision account.
