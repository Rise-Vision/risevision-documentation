1. Click the Settings link at the top of any Rise Vision page, and on the Settings page, click the checkbox in the Allow Alerts field.  This is a global setting which allows alerts for your company.  Checking this field reveals several new fields underneath.
2. In the Acceptance field, read the information, follow the recommendations provided and keep the checkbox checked if you agree.  Use of the alerts service requires this field to be checked to indicate your consent to these terms of use.
3. The Web Service URL field shows the URL that the 3rd party alert service sends your CAP 1.2 alert messages to.  If you need to change the URL for security or other reasons, click the Reset link.  This opens a window reminding you to inform your alert service of the new URL.  Click the OK button to confirm the reset.
4. In the Authentication Name and Authentication Password fields, enter the login name and password required to authenticate alert posts, if this information is supported by your alert provider.

###Add an Alert Presentation
1. In the Presentation field, select which of your presentations to show on the display when an alert is sent.  Click the Change link to open a Select Presentation window showing a list of all of your presentations.  Click the Select link beside the name of the presentation that you wish to use for alerts.  This closes the window and puts the name of the selected presentation in this field.

	If you wish to use it, an pre-built Alert Presentation template is available from the Presentations page.  To use it, first go to the Presentations page, click the Add from Template button to preview it and to add the template named “Alert Presentation” to your list of presentations.  Then return to this Presentation field on the Settings page and follow the instructions in the previous paragraph to select your copy of “Alert Presentation”.

2. In the Distribution field, if you only want the alerts to show on certain displays in your network, you can select those displays by clicking the Edit link to the right of “All displays”.  This opens a Distribution window with a list of your displays.  Click the checkbox beside the name of each display that you wish to select, and then click the Save button.  
3. In the Default Expiry field, specify the length of time (in minutes) that the alert will be shown if the Expiration Date/Time of the alert has not been specified by the alert provider.
