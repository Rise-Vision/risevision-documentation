Alerts are rapidly-distributed notifications – such as emergency messages – that appear on your displays as soon as they are sent to them, interrupting their regular display schedules.  The Rise Vision alert service gives you the ability to set up an emergency notification system that automatically overrides the content on your digital signs to deliver critical, real time, visual messages to your audience.  

To set up your alert system, you will need a 3rd party alert service that is CAP 1.2 (Common Alerting Protocol)-compliant.  You also need to allow alerts for your company in the Settings area of the Rise Vision platform.  When you do so, the alerts will appear on all of the displays that you have selected in the Distribution field.  Alerts appear within a presentation that you designate as your Alert Presentation.
