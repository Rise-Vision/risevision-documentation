The Rise Vision platform has the capacity to monitor your displays and to notify you if one of them fails. This display monitoring feature lets you configure your Rise Vision account to send you an email notification as soon as it detects that any of your displays' Rise Vision Chrome App Player has not checked in for content updates in the last 30 minutes.

In other words, if 30 minutes goes by and the system has not received a request from one of your display's players, an email message is sent to you to inform you of the display's lack of activity. This gives you the chance to check the display and troubleshoot any problems if necessary.

Once the problem is fixed and the system gets a new request from the display's player, a follow-up email is sent to you to let you know that your player is now back online.

####Setting up monitoring for your displays
Display monitoring setup is controlled in two areas of Rise Vision: first, you have to list the email address(es) of the intended recipient(s) in the Settings area of the platform, and then you have to check the "Monitor" box on the display settings page of each display that you wish to monitor. In detail:

######To configure monitoring

1. Within Rise Vision, click the “Settings” link at the top of any page. This takes you to your company's settings page.
2. In the "Monitoring Emails" field, enter the email address of every person in your company to whom monitoring emails should be sent if one of your displays fails. If you are adding multiple email addresses to this field, separate each one with a comma.
3. Then, click the “Displays” link at the top of any page. This takes you to the page listing all of your displays.
4. Click the name of any display that you wish to monitor. This takes you to its settings page.
5. Click the checkbox in the "Monitor" field to begin monitoring that display.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for any other displays that you also wish to monitor.
