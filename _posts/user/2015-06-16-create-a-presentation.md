A Presentation is an HTML page made up of Images, Videos, Text and other content that you want shown on your Displays.  You can create multiple Presentations and manage when they are displayed by using a Schedule.

###How do I create a Presentation?
Select Presentations from the main menu and then click **[+ Add presentation]**. You can start with a Blank Presentation, or a Template. Templates are pre-built Presentations that you can customize to your liking. There are both Free Templates and Premium Templates available. You can also make your own Templates and share them with your Company (or Sub-Companies) by saving a Presentation as a Template.

###How do I edit a Presentation?
The Editor is where you create and edit your Presentations. To set  the resolution and background images for a  Presentation, just click on the cog next to your Presentation Name. Within a  Presentation you can can add Placeholders and insert Widgets like Text, Images, Videos, Spreadsheets, Calendars, Weather, Web Pages and more. Widgets can be shown within the Placeholder according to the defined Playlist. You define the placement, size, and background for  how you want your Placeholders to appear. To see what your Presentation looks like on a  Display just click **[Save & Preview]**.
