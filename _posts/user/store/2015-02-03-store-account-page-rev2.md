##What is the Account page?
The Rise Vision Store's Account page is the area of the store where you can view the various details of your store-related interactions, including orders placed, invoices due, subscriptions, subscription trials, invoice history and a log of your company's store-related activity.

To access your Account page:
1. Click the Store link in the top menu of any Rise Vision page.
2. Click the Account link in the top menu of the Store page. This takes you to a page with several store-related sections. Each section is explained below.

##Account Page Sections##
####Orders####
This area shows a list of purchases made by your company for products and/or services that must be fulfilled by the vendor.  For example, a media player that must be shipped to you, or a service (like training or content design) that must be provided to you, by the seller. 

Details listed for each order include the date, order ID, product name, quantity ordered, total cost and the current status of the order.  The status field will either show Open for those orders still pending fulfillment, or Closed for orders that have already been fulfilled.

####Invoices Due####
This area shows a list of subscriptions that require payment because they could not be automatically renewed. Normally, renewal fees for your subscriptions are automatically charged to the credit card on file for your account. If the transaction fails, an invoice for this subscription will appear in this section as Overdue, and you then have a 15-day grace period to correct the situation. During that time, you can continue to use the product in question. If the invoice is still unpaid after 15 days, your subscription will be suspended and the product will stop working.

Details listed for each invoice include the date, the amount, and the status. The status field will either show Overdue for subscriptions that are still working but require payment, or Service Suspended for invoices that remain unpaid after the 15-day grace period.

####Subscriptions####
This area shows a list of all active subscriptions for content (i.e., widgets) and service (e.g., Storage) that your company has purchased. Details listed for each subscription include the subscription ID, product name, unit of purchase, price per unit, ship-to address (i.e., parent or sub-company) and status (normally shows as Active).

####Subscription Trials####
This area shows a list of content (widget) subscriptions that your company is currently using on a trial basis. A trial starts once a widget that offers a trial period is run on one of your company's displays. Once the trial period has begun, the widget will be listed in this area. Details listed for each subscription trial include the name of the subscription (widget), and the status indicating when the trial period expires.

####Invoice History####
This area shows a list of invoices that have been issued to your company. Details listed for each invoice include the invoice number, date and amount. A CSV link is also provided if you wish to download the invoice in CSV (comma-separated values) table format.

####Log####
This area shows a log of all past store activity for your company, including invoices generated, subscriptions cancelled, etc. Date and details are shown for each log entry.
