##Can I place my order by calling you?
Not at this time. Currently all purchases have to be made through [store.risevision.com](https://store.risevision.com).

##Which credit card types do you accept?

##The status of my subscription hasn’t changed even though I paid for it?
Refresh the page in your browser and it should update to reflect the current status. If it doesn’t contact us using the form below or email us at [store@risevision.com](mailto:store@risevision.com).

##I purchased a subscription for the wrong company, how do I move it?
We can’t move an existing subscription to a different company so you’ll need to purchase it for the company you want and we’ll refund the original charge. Once you made the purchase cancel the original subscription that is under the wrong company and send us the invoice number for the original charge that you’d like refunded.

##Can I cancel my subscription at anytime?
Yes. You can cancel at anytime but we do not offer refunds for a partially used subscription. For example, lets say you subscribed on April 1 for a monthly subscription and cancelled halfway through the month on April 15. You would continue to have service through April 30 with no additional charges after that.
