##How to purchase for a sub-company
In addition to purchasing items for your own company from the Rise Vision Store, you can also purchase items for any one of your sub-companies. To do so, simply switch to the desired sub-company in the Store area of the platform before placing your order.

To switch to a sub-company in the Store area:

1. Go to the Store by clicking the Store link in the top menu of any Rise Vision page.  (You can also access the Store from the Presentations area of the platform, by adding new content to a placeholder.) 
2. Click the Current Company (gear) icon in the top right corner of the page (to the right of the shopping cart icon).  This opens a Current Company sub-menu, showing the name of your parent company as the top menu item.
3. Click Select Sub-Company. This opens a new Select Sub-Company window listing your sub-companies. If no sub-companies are listed, you will have to add your sub-company to the platform first (see [Add a Sub-Company](http://help.risevision.com/#/user/company/add-a-sub-company)).
4. Click the name of the desired sub-company.  This closes the Select Sub-Company window and adds a notice to the top of the page saying "You're in Sub-Company (name)  Switch to My Company". This reminds you that you're purchasing for that sub-company, and offers a link if you want to switch back to the parent company.

Once you've switched to the sub-company, the process of purchasing an item is the same as when purchasing for your parent company (see [How to purchase an item from the Store](/#/user/store/how-to-purchase-item-from-store)). The difference is that on your shopping cart page, the "Ship To" address will now show the address of the sub-company that you selected as the recipient of the purchase.
