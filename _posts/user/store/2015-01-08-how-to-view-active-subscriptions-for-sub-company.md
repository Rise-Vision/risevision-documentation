##How to view active subscriptions for a sub-company
In addition to viewing your own company's active subscriptions, you can also view those for any one of your sub-companies, in the same Account area of the Rise Vision Store. To do so, simply switch to the desired sub-company before reviewing the Subscriptions area of the Account page.

To switch to a sub-company in the Store area:

1. Go to the Store by clicking the Store link in the top menu of any Rise Vision page.  (You can also access the Store from the Presentations area of the platform, by adding new content to a placeholder.) 
2. Click the Current Company (gear) icon in the top right corner of the page (to the right of the shopping cart icon).  This opens a Current Company sub-menu, showing the name of your parent company as the top menu item.
3. Click Select Sub-Company. This opens a new Select Sub-Company window listing your sub-companies. If no sub-companies are listed, you will have to add your sub-company to the platform first (see [Add a Sub-Company](http://help.risevision.com/#/user/company/add-a-sub-company)).
4. Click the name of the desired sub-company.  This closes the Select Sub-Company window and adds a notice to the top of the page saying "You're in Sub-Company (name)  Switch to My Company". This reminds you that you're viewing information for that sub-company, and offers a link if you want to switch back to the parent company.

Once you've switched to the sub-company, the process of viewing active subscriptions is the same as when viewing them for your parent company: they are listed in the Subscriptions area of the Account page (see [How to view your active subscriptions](/#/user/store/how-to-view-active-subscriptions) for details). The difference is that once you've switched to the sub-company, you will see *its* active subscriptions, not those of your parent company.
