##How to view your active subscriptions
Information about your company's active subscriptions is shown in the Account area of the Rise Vision Store.

To view your subscriptions:

1. Click the Store link in the top menu of any Rise Vision page.
2. Click the Account link in the top menu of the Store page. This takes you to your company's Account page, showing details such as Orders, Invoices Due, Subscriptions, etc.
3. The Subscriptions area of your Account page shows a list of all active subscriptions that your company has purchased for content (i.e., widgets) and service (e.g., Storage). If you have numerous active subscriptions, you can see the full list by clicking the "Show All >" link on the right side of the Subscriptions area.

Details listed for each subscription include the subscription ID, product name, unit of purchase, price per unit, ship-to address (i.e., parent or sub-company) and status (which normally shows as Active).
