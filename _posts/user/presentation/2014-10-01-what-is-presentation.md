A presentation is a specific layout of content items – which can include text, images, videos, HTML and widgets – arranged for display on digital signs.  Presentations can be designed with our presentation editor, saved as templates, assigned to displays by putting them into schedules, and sent to displays using the Rise Player.  There’s no limit to the number of presentations you can design.
 
Like web pages, presentations are built in HTML, and their layouts can be previewed in a web browser.  You add content to a presentation using the presentation editor, in either the Design view (if you prefer a WYSIWYG editing environment) or the HTML view (if you’re an advanced user comfortable with editing HTML directly).  Because they’re HTML pages, presentations can use any content that you create for the web, and any content that you create for a presentation can also be used on the web.
