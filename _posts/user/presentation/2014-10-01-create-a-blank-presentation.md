In addition to starting a presentation from a presentation template, you can also add a presentation to your list by creating one from scratch.  Clicking the Add button on the Presentations page will give you a blank canvas; adding placeholders will allow you to create your own layout; creating playlists for each placeholder will allow you to add content into them; and previewing your presentation will allow you to see how it will look on your digital displays.  Instructions for each step of this process are provided below.

To create a presentation:

1. Click the Presentations link at the top of the Rise Vision page.
2. Click the Add button (top right corner).  This will open a brand new blank presentation in the presentation editor, with a default resolution of 1920 x 1080 and the default name “New Presentation”.
3. Click the Save icon (the floppy disk icon) to save your new presentation.  Now you can start adding content placeholders to it.
