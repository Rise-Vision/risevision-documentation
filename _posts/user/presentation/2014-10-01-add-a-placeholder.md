To add a placeholder to a presentation:

1. Click the Add Placeholder icon (the square blue “+” icon), which will place a new blank 400x200 placeholder into your presentation and open a new Placeholder window above it where you can define its properties.
2. In the Placeholder field, rename the placeholder by clicking the Rename link.  Delete the default name, type in the new name and click Save.
3. In the next 4 fields, enter the Width, Height, Top position and Left position of the placeholder in pixels.  Alternatively, you can just use your mouse to click the placeholder (which is directly underneath the properties window) and drag it to any location on the screen and resize it to the desired dimensions.  If you want it to maintain its aspect ratio while you are resizing it, hold the Shift key down while dragging your mouse to resize it.
4. In the Timeline field, specify when this placeholder is visible.  By default, it is set to be always visible.  To change that, click the Edit link and pick your schedule preferences in the Timeline window.  Click the Save button to save your preferences.
5. In the Distribution field, specify where this placeholder is visible.  By default, it is set to All Displays.  To change that, click the Edit link and pick specific displays in the Distribution window.  Click the Save button to save your preferences.
6. In the Visible field, uncheck the checkbox (which is set to Visible by default) if you don’t want this placeholder to be visible.
7.  In the Transition field, select how the items in the placeholder’s playlist will appear when they transition from one item to the next.  This is similar to the choices available for the transition effects between photos in a slideshow.
8. In the Background field, specify a background image or color for your placeholder.  Click Edit to specify a background color (by entering its HEX or RGB value, or by choosing it via the Color Picker), or enter the URL for a background image.  If your image does not fill the entire placeholder, you can choose the image position, make it scale to fit the whole screen, or have it repeat in a tile format, vertically and/or horizontally.  Click Save to save your background settings and return to the Placeholder window.
9. Under the Background field, there is a horizontal line which indicates the beginning of the playlist area for this placeholder.  If no items have been added yet, the only things shown directly underneath the line are the message “(Playlist is empty)” and an Edit link.  Adding items to the playlist is the topic of the next section.
10. Click the Save button to save your placeholder settings and return to the presentation editor.
11. Click the Save icon (the floppy disk icon) to save the changes to your presentation.
