1. In the presentation editor, click the Preview icon (the green “play” symbol) in the top right corner.  This opens a new tab with a preview of the presentation, showing you how it will appear on a digital display.  You can see the design and layout of the overall presentation, the contents of all the placeholders, the timing of all playlists and schedules, and the data and motion created by any widgets, videos and animations that are included in the presentation.
2. You can show or hide the header at the top of the preview tab by clicking on the Hide/Show (eyeball) icon.
3. Once you’ve seen and  evaluated the preview, you can close the preview tab, which returns you to the presentation editor.
