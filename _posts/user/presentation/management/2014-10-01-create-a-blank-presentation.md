To create a presentation:

1. Click the Presentations link at the top of the Rise Vision page.
2. Click the Add button (top right corner).  This will open a brand new blank presentation in the presentation editor, with a default resolution of 1920 x 1080 and the default name “New Presentation”.
3. Click the Save icon (the floppy disk icon) to save your new presentation.  Now you can start adding content placeholders to it.
