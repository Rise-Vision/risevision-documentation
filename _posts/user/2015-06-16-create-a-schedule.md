A Schedule defines when, and on what Displays, your Presentations and Web Pages appear.
The ‘when’ is controlled by the Timeline (by default set to ‘Always’), and the ‘where’ is managed by the Distribution (by default set to ‘All Displays’). You can of course, change the default and refine both the ‘when’ and ‘where’ to meet your needs.

But keep in mind that a Display **cannot** be double-booked. It can only be assigned to **one** Schedule at a time. 

###How do I add Presentations and Web Pages to my Schedule?
Presentations and Web Pages are added to a Schedule’s Playlist. The Playlist controls the order they appear in, how long they should appear (Duration), when they should appear (Timeline) and where they appear (Distribution). The Timeline and Distribution for the Playlist works within the scope of the Timeline and Distribution for the Schedule. For example: If your Schedule says that it plays from 9 to 5 Monday through Friday (Timeline) on Displays 1, 2, and 3 (Distribution), and you add a Presentation to your Schedule Playlist that plays from 9 to 6 Monday through Saturday on Displays 1, 2, 3 and 4 it will never show up after 5pm, nor play on Saturday and won’t appear on Display 4. The Schedule Timeline and Distribution controls the boundaries of ‘when’ and ‘where’ things can play. The Playlist Timeline and Distribution can only work within that scope.
