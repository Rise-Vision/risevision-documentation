### Register Player with your Company
After installing the Rise Vision Player, your need to connect it to your company (i.e., register it) in the Rise Vision platform.  When you first launch Player will prompt you to enter either a Display ID or your Claim ID to connect your display to the Rise Vision platform.  

A display ID is a unique identifier assigned to each display that you add to the platform.  Your claim ID is the unique identifier assigned to your company by the platform and used by Player to automatically register displays to your company.

To find and add them:

###How to find a Display ID
1. To add a new display, click the Displays link at the top of any Rise Vision page, and then click the Add Display button. 
2. Give the new display a name and click Save. 
3. Copy the alphanumeric key that now appears in the Display ID field.
4. Start up the Rise Vision Player and enter the display ID when prompted.

###How to find your Claim ID
1. Click the Settings link at the top of any Rise Vision page, and locate and copy the alphanumeric key shown in the Claim ID field. 
2. Start up the Rise Vision Player and enter your claim ID when prompted. 
3. Next, name your display, and Player will automatically create the display in the Rise Vision Platform for you.
