###What is Player?
The Rise Vision Player is the software that must be installed on the computer portion of your display in order to be able to show content from the Rise Vision platform.  It’s the software that takes the presentations and schedules that you create in the platform and sends them to your display screen.

The word “player” is also used in the term “media player”, which refers to the computer portion of your display, i.e., to the device that connects to and powers your digital sign.   But in general, when we talk about the Player, we’re referring to the software.


###Where can I download Player?
To download the Player software, go to http://www.risevision.com/player/ and select the version made for the operating system used by your display’s computer/media player.
