3. Scroll down until you find "Enable debugging for packed apps" and click Enable.
4. Close the Chrome browser.

######Special note about Chromeboxes running in Kiosk Mode:
- Ctrl+w will not exit the player.

3. Click on the Console item in the menu along the top of the new window.
4. This window can be moved and resized as desired.
