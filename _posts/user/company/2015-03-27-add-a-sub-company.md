###What is a Sub-Company?
If you’re using the Rise Vision platform as a service provider – that is, to set up your own clients’ displays on the platform – you can add your clients as sub-companies within your parent company account.  This gives you the ability to create and update users, displays, presentations, schedules, and widgets for any customer (sub-company) at any time, and to make all shared widgets and presentation templates from your parent company available to them as well.
 
The management of your sub-companies is done using the Select Sub-Company | Add Sub-Company | Move a Company Under Your Company links accessed by clicking your username icon in the header area of the platform.
 
###Add a Sub-Company
To add a sub-company to your account:

1. Click your username icon in the top right header area of any page. This opens a sub-menu of company-related items.
2. Click the Add Sub-Company link. This opens a new Add Sub-Company window.
3. Enter the name, contact and time zone information for the new sub-company in the fields displayed. In the "Send Monitoring Emails To" field, enter the email address to which notification emails should be sent from any display that is set up to be monitored (i.e., to alert the person in that sub-company when a display fails or recovers).
1. Click the green Save button to save your newly added sub-company. This closes the Add Sub-Company window.
