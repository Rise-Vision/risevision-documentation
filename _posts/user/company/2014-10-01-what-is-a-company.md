In the Rise Vision platform, the company is the organization to which you, as a user, belong.  You must specify the name of your company when you first set up your Rise Vision account.  Henceforth, whenever you sign in to the Rise Vision platform, your User ID is shown in the top right corner of the screen (to the left of the “Sign Out” link), and your company name is shown directly underneath your username.
 

If you’re using the Rise Vision platform as a service provider – that is, to set up your own clients’ displays on the platform – you can add your clients as sub-companies within your parent company account.  This gives you the ability to create and update users, displays, presentations, schedules, and widgets for any client (sub-company) at any time.
