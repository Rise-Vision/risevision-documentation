In the Rise Vision platform, the company is the organization to which you, as a user, belong.  You must specify the name of your company when you first set up your Rise Vision account.  Henceforth, whenever you sign in to the Rise Vision platform, your User ID is shown in the top right corner of the screen (to the left of the “Sign Out” link), and your company name is shown directly underneath your username.
 
Companies can have multiple users, displays, and sub-companies (i.e., client companies).  A parent company can be changed into a sub-company of another parent company, and sub-companies can be moved from one parent company to another.
