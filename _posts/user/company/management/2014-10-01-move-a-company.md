If a user already has a company on the Rise Vision platform and wants to be part of your network, you can make it a sub-company of your network by moving it.  You will need the Authentication Key of the company you wish to move.
 
To move a company into your account:

1. Click the Move a Company link at the top of the Settings page and enter the Authentication Key of the company that you want to move.
2.  If the key is valid, it displays the name of the company so you can confirm if that is in fact the company you want to move.
3. If it is, click the Accept button, and that company is now a sub-company in your network.  Then click the Cancel button to close the “Move a Company to your Network” window.
