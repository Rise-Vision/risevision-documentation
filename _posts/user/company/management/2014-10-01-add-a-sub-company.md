###What is a Sub-Company?
If you’re using the Rise Vision platform as a service provider – that is, to set up your own clients’ displays on the platform – you can add your clients as sub-companies within your parent company account.  This gives you the ability to create and update users, displays, presentations, schedules, and widgets for any customer (sub-company) at any time, and to make all shared widgets and presentation templates from your parent company available to them as well.
 
The management of your sub-companies is done using the Add a Company | Move a Company | Switch to a Company links located at the top of the Settings page.
 
###Add a Sub-Company
To add a sub-company to your account:

1. Click the Add a Company link at the top of the Settings page and enter the information for the new sub-company in the fields displayed.  (See the Company Settings section above for explanations of each of the fields.)
1. Click Save to save your newly added sub-company.
1. After clicking Save, you are taken to the Settings page for that sub-company, whose name is now displayed both on the top left side of the page (beneath the top banner) and on the top right side of the page (in red, within the banner).
1.  If you wish to add more sub-companies, you must first return to the Settings page of your parent company.  To do so, click the Reset link in the top right corner of the page.
