As a parent company, you can switch to the Settings page of any of your sub-companies whenever you want to manage that sub-company’s users, presentations, widgets, storage, displays or schedules.
 
To switch to a sub-company’s account:

1. Click the Switch to a Company link at the top left side of the Settings page, or click the Switch link in the top right corner of any page. 
1. This opens a Select Company window, and all sub-companies that you had previously added or moved to your company will be listed in the table shown under the Search box.
1. Click the Select link beside the name of the sub-company that you want to switch to.
1. This will take you to the corresponding page of that sub-company.  The sub-company’s name is now displayed on the top right side of all pages (in red, within the banner).  On the Settings page, it also appears on the top left side (beneath the top banner).
1. You can now navigate around the platform, and make changes, as the sub-company.
