####Obtain a Product Code
If you will be selling a product that requires authorization from the Rise Vision Store, you will need to obtain a Product Code. The Product Code is an ID with your product when you register it in the Store. 

A Product Code required by the API to determine which if a product should be authorized by Display (or Company). The API will throw an error if no Product Code or an incorrect Product Code are added to the request.

To request a Product Code for your Application or Widget please complete the form here, http://www.risevision.com/store-api-request-form/.
