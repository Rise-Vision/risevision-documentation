###What is Store Authorization
Store Authorization is a mechanism we provide for you to authorize your Apps (which could be mobile or desktop apps, widgets, gadgets, presentations or templates with embedded scripts, or any other pieces of code you created that are able to use HTTPS to connect to our Store server) with our Store based on their purchase status and the Customer account standing. Simply put, this is what ensures that only those who purchased your Apps are allowed to use them.

Whenever Store Authorization API is called by your App our Store records the usage of the App by the Customer whose display is running the App. This is how the Store knows who to bill and for how much for the usage of your App. It means that calling Store Authorization API  is what allows you to get paid for Apps you sell through our Store.  

Store Authorization also provides the ability to authorize Apps (successfully authorized by our Store) with your Servers (if applicable). In other words, if you have a Server that supplies data or performs some functionality, or supports your Apps in some way, this is what helps ensure that only those who paid for the App are allowed to use your Server.

###How it all works (The Big Picture)

![Apps that are NOT used on individual Displays]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/store-auth-app.png)

**Viewer** is a web app that runs content on Displays. Widgets you develop will be incorporated into that content.

**Display ID** is a unique ID our system uses to identify Customer displays. Widgets can request the ID of the Display they are running on from the Viewer.

**Company ID** is a unique ID our system uses to identify Customer company. 

**Product Code** is issued by us. It identifies the Widget to the Store.

**Server Keys** are issued by us. They allow your Servers to validate App requests without having to connect to the Store server.

**Signature** is produced from Display ID, Product Code, Expiry Time and the appropriate Server Key on the Server. Apps only need to pass the Signature they receive from the Store to the appropriate Server (if applicable), no processing or calculations on the Widget side is required.

###Getting Started
####Sign Up
You will probably want to create an account in our system (http://www.risevision.com/) so that you can create some content to test your Apps with and a few test displays to run the content on.

####Requesting Keys
#####If You Are Developing an App
You will need to contact us at support@risevision.com and provide the following information about your App:

- Your company name
- Your website URL
- Your contact email
- Product name
- Product descriptions (a short one and a more detailed one) (max number of characters in each?)
- URL of the Product icon (size?)
- URL of the Product image (size?)
- Pricing options: per display per month and/or per company per month (you can have both), or Free

Someone on our side will review the information you provided and if everything looks good they will send you a Product Code that your App will need to use whenever it calls Store Authorization API. If your App is Free, it does not need to call Store Authorization API, the Product Code will only be needed to identify your Product in the Store.

#####If You Are Developing a Server
You will need to contact us at support@risevision.com and provide the following information about your Server:

- Your company name
- Your website URL
- Your contact email
- Server ID you want to use for your server (up to 50 characters long, letters and numbers only)

Someone on our side will review the information you provided and if everything looks good they will send you a Server Key that corresponds to the Server ID you sent us. This is a “secret” key, so you should keep it safe just like any password. This key should only be used in your Server code for verifying signatures received from Apps, no other app should include Server Key in their code for security reasons.

If you suspect that your Server Key may have been compromised, just let us know and we will issue a new one. Once you replace the key in your Server code your Apps will immediately start working with the new key. No changes in the App code will be needed. 

####Implementing the API
#####If You Are Developing an App

You need to call Store Authorization API when you need to check if the App is authorized or not. Typically you would call it upon startup and then as soon (or shortly before) the authorization expires. You should not call this API needlessly as there is a protection mechanism that would block your App if you call our server too often.

To call Store Authorization API, send the following GET request **over SSL**:

*For Apps that are used on individual Displays:*

`https://store-dot-rvaserver2.appspot.com/v1/widget/auth?callback=callback_function_name&id=display_id&pc=product_code&srv=serverIdA,serverIdB`

*For Apps that are NOT used on individual Displays:*

`https://store-dot-rvaserver2.appspot.com/v1/widget/auth?callback=callback_function_name&cid=company_id&pc=product_code&srv=serverIdA,serverIdB`

*Query Parameters:*

`callback` is a name of JavaScript function that will be used in JSONP response that API will return. This parameter is optional, if you don’t provide it, regular JSON (not JSONP) response will be returned.

`id` is the ID of a display the Apps is running on. If your App is a part of the content (e.g. it’s a widget or gadget), it can obtain this ID from the Viewer as described here. Javascript code you will need to paste into your widget is:

```javascript
gadgets.rpc.call("", "rsparam_get", null, id, "displayId");
gadgets.rpc.register("rsparam_set_" + your_gadget_id, response);

function response(name, value) {
  // Viewer will call this function with name=’displayId’ and value=ID of the display
};
```
In order to communicate with the Viewer your widget needs to include the following script:

```
<script src="//rvashow2.appspot.com/gadgets/gadgets.min.js"></script>
```

`cid` is the ID of the company that uses the App. 

`pc` is the Product Code we issued for your App

`srv` is a comma-separated list of Server IDs you want to get signatures for. This parameter can be omitted.

If callback parameter was provided the Store server will respond with the following JSONP:

*Success (signatures requested):*

`callback_function_name({“authorized”:true,"expiry_time":”yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ”, “signatures”:[{“serverId”:”serverIdA”, “value”:”signatureA”},{“serverId”:”serverIdB”, “value”:”signatureB”}]});`

*Success (signatures NOT requested):*

`callback_function_name({“authorized”:true,"expiry_time":”yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ”, “signatures”:null});`

*Error*

`callback_function_name({“authorized”:false,"expiry_time":null, “signatures”:null});`

If the callback parameter was not provided the Store server will respond with the following JSON

*Success (signatures requested):*

`{“authorized”:true,"expiry_time":”yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ”, “signatures”:[{“serverId”:”serverIdA”, “value”:”signatureA”},{“serverId”:”serverIdB”, “value”:”signatureB”}], “error”:null}`

*Success (signatures NOT requested):*

`{“authorized”:true,"expiry_time":”yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ”, “signatures”:null, “error”:null}`

*Error*

`{“authorized”:false,"expiry_time":null, “signatures”:null, “error”:{“message”:error_message}}`

`authorized = true` means that your Widget is authorized until expiry_time
`expiry_time` contains UTC time of authorization expiry
`signatures` is an array of *(serverId, value)* pairs.


**Complete Example:**

*Request:*

`https://store-dot-rvaserver2.appspot.com/v1/widget/auth?callback=myCallback&id=ABCD1234&pc=40bd001563085fc35165329ea1ff5c5ecbdbbeef&srv=RiseFinancial`

*Response:*

`myCallback({“authorized”:true,"expiry_time":”2014-03-27T18:25:43.511Z”, “signatures”:[{“serverId”:”RiseFinancial”, “value”:”8cb2237d0679ca88db6464eac60da96345513964”}], “error”:null});`

**Implementation Notes**

It is up to your App how to react to authorization expiry (or lack of authorization on startup), the Store can only tell you if you authorized or not. 

It is generally a good idea to call the Store server a few minutes before the authorization expiry time and renew the authorization (it would also leave you some extra time to retry the call in case of connection errors).

**How to use Server Signatures**

Strictly speaking this is between your App and your Server. You can pass the signature to your Server as part of your data request or however you deem appropriate. The important point to remember is that in addition to the signature itself the Server would need the following pieces of data in order to verify the signature:

**Display ID (or Company ID)**: exactly the same as `id` (or `cid`) parameter you passed to Store Authorization API. 
**Product Code**: exactly the same as `pc` parameter you passed to Store Authorization API. 
**Expiry Time**: exactly the same as `expiry_time` value you received in Store Authorization API response.

It is up to you how to send these 3 to your Server, but generally it is a good idea to pass them in the same request as the signature itself.

#####If You Are Developing a Server
Your Server needs to verify that the App is authorized by the Store to request the data at a given time on a given Display and by given Product. Here’s how it should do it:

First the Server confirms that Expiry Time (UTC) passed by the App is not before the current UTC time. If it is, the authorization has expired. 

If the authorization has not yet expired the Server uses the Server Key we issued for it to compute the signature from Display ID, Product Code and Expiry Time passed by the App as follows:

1. Concatenate `Display ID + ‘#’ + Product Code + ‘#’ + Server Key + ‘#’ + Expiry Date formatted as “yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.sssZ”`

2. Compute a SHA1 digest of the concatenated string.

Java Example:

```java
static public String bytes2String(byte[] bytes) {

	StringBuilder string = new StringBuilder();
	for (byte b: bytes) {
		String hex = Integer.toHexString(0x00FF & b);
		string.append(hex.length() == 1 ? "0" + hex : hex);
	}
	return string.toString();
}

static public String getSHA1Hash(String s) {

	String result = "";
	try {
		MessageDigest sha1 = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA1");
		byte[] digest = sha1.digest(s.getBytes());
		result = bytes2String(digest);
	} catch (Exception e) {
	result = "";
	}
	return result;
}

....

String s = displayId + "#" + productCode + "#" + serverKey + "#" + new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.sssZ").format(expiryTime); 

String signature = getSHA1Hash(s);
```

If the computed signature matches the signature passed by the App, the App is authorized to receive data for Display ID and Product Code until Expiry Time.
