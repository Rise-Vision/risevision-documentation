###Channel signals

The following signals can be sent by the Core to the Viewer over the Channel:

####Parameters

| Signal    | Meaning |
|:--------|:------------|
| **updated** *request_ticket*  | Content has been updated, Viewer should request content update from the Core. Viewer should pass `request_ticket` in the request as a query parameter. |

**request_ticket** is a random sequence of 20 characters. It is used to avoid accidental blocking by the Core as the request it is passed with is exempted from the rate calculation the Core uses for blocking.
Request ticket is single use, passing it with subsequent requests has no effect.
