The Cache API is used by the Viewer to cache video files. In our case, Rise Cache is a standalone Java application that listens for HTTP requests on port 9494. The benefits of using Rise Cache include:

- Videos are only downloaded once instead of every time the Player is started.
- Unused videos are kept for 30 days before being deleted.
- Rise Cache checks if a video has changed every time it is requested, but not more often than once every five minutes. If it has, it will be downloaded in the background.
